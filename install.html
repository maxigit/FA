Installation</span></strong></div>
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
<li>A working HTTP web server eg. <em><strong>Apache,
IIS</strong></em>. </li>
<li><strong><em>PHP</em></strong>
installed on the web server. </li>
<li>A working <strong><em>MySQL</em></strong>
server - with <strong><em>innodb</em></strong>
tables enabled (see notes below) </li>
<li><strong><em>Adobe Acrobat Reader</em></strong>
- for viewing the PDF reports before printing them out. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>One critical aspect of the PHP installation is the setting
of <strong><em>session.auto_start</em></strong>
in the php.ini file. Some rpm distributions of PHP have the default
setting of <strong><em>session.auto_start = 1</em></strong>.
This starts a new session at the beginning of each script. However,
this makes it impossible to instantiate any class objects that the
system relies on. Classes are used extensively by this system. When
sessions are required they are started by the system and this setting
of <strong><em>session.auto_start</em></strong>
can and should be set to 0. </li>
<li><strong><em>Innodb</em></strong>
tables must be enabled in the MySQL server. These tables allow database
transactions which are a critical component of the software. This is
enabled by default in the newer versions of MySQL. If you need to
enable it yourself, consult the MySQL manual. </li>
<li>FrontAccounting is implemented and tested with MySQL.
Generally
it should work with other databases, but this is not supported in any
way at the moment. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Copying all the project files to the correct directory</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must obviously have downloaded the project archive to
be reading this file. </li>
<li>All the files inside this archive should be copied to a
directory under the web server root directory. </li>
<li>For example, create a folder called <strong>/account</strong>,
and extract the archive into this folder. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation Steps (automatic, recommended)</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you have the option to create multiple databases on your
host, create one, fi. <strong>frontacc</strong>, otherwise
write down the database name for your account. At the same time look up
the username and password for the database. You will need these
informations during the wizard install. </li>
<li>Enter <strong><em>your_url/account/install</em></strong>
(or whatever directory you entered). This will run the install wizard,
setup a drill company and populating with initial data. You can later
on create your own real company. It is a good idea to get familiar with
the system before starting your own company.&nbsp; </li>
<li>After successfully install, remove or rename your install
directory for safety reasons. You don't need it any more.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installation Steps (manuel, for advanced users, not
recommended)</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
<ol>
<li>NOTE : As FrontAccounting is still heavily under
development, the database structure will ALWAYS change between
releases, so if you have a database that you created for a previous
release of FrontAccounting, it WILL NOT WORK after installing a new
release. You may run the script, update_db.php and select the
appropriate script, f.i. alter.sql&nbsp; and alter2.sql (from
release 1.XX to release 2.0). </li>
<li>We strongly suggest using a GUI to manage your
database(s) and database users. If you don&#8217;t have any, download <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/"><strong>phpMyAdmin</strong></a>.
</li>
<li>Create a database with a name of your choice. The
default in config_db.php is &#8216;<strong><em>frontacc</em></strong>&#8217;,
but of course you can select whatever name you desire. </li>
<li>Populate the database you have created. There are two
scripts
are provided to populate the database (both inside the folder /sql) :
<ol>
<li><strong><em>en_US-demo.sql</em></strong>.
This has a minimal amount of demonstration data set up so that
transactions can be tried to see how the system works. </li>
<li><strong><em>en_US-new.sql</em></strong>.
This script has
only the basic data necessary to start a new company system off. If you
wish to set up your company on FrontAccounting then this is the script
to use. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Now that the database is created you will need to set
up a database user to access this database. DO NOT USE THE USER &#8216;ROOT&#8217;.
Set up a new user and give that user full privileges over the database
&#8216;frontacc&#8217;. </li>
<li>After successfully install, remove or rename your
install directory <strong><em>your_url/account/install</em></strong>
(or
whatever directory you entered) for safety reasons. You don't need it
any more.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Editing config_db.php</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>config_db.php</em></strong>
contains connection information for the database. These must be set to
your local settings or you will not be able to access FrontAccounting. </li>
<li>FrontAccounting allows multiple connections, you can
enter as many connections as you have separate entities (most people
will use only one). </li>
<li><strong>$db_connections</strong> is an
array of connections &#8211; for each connection : </li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>name</strong>&#8221; is the name of the
connection, this is the name that will be displayed to the user </li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>host</strong>&#8221; is the computer IP
address or name where the database is. The default is localhost
assuming that the web server is also the sql server. </li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>dbuse</strong>r&#8221; is the user name
under which the database should be accessed. NB, again, do not use the
user ROOT. A user with appropriate privileges must be set up. </li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>dbpassword</strong>&#8221; is the
password for &#8220;dbuser&#8221;. You would have entered this when you created
&#8220;dbuser&#8221;. </li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>dbname</strong>&#8221; is the name of
the database. The provided scripts use the name OpenAccounting. </li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>tbpref</strong>&#8221; is the table
prefix for
the tables. If you only have access to one database, you must use table
prefix to separate the companies. Table prefix is set by a table prefix
counter inside config_db.php, fi. 0_ for the first company.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;Logging In For the First Time</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pleae ensure that the folder <strong>/company/0</strong>
on the server is <strong>writable</strong>. </li>
<li>Open a browser and enter the URL for the web server
directory where FrontAccounting is installed. </li>
<li>Enter the user name:&nbsp; '<strong>admin</strong>'
</li>
<li>Enter the password: '<strong>password</strong>'
</li>
<li>(NB : enter without quotation marks). </li>
<li>
<div>You can set up additional user accounts from the System
Setup
tab. Be careful not to delete the demonstration user until a new user
has been set up. If there are no users defined the next time you try to
login you won't be able to. The only way then to create a user to login
with is to manually edit the SQL table "users" to insert a user.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Setting Up Company Specific Data</h2>
<ol>
<li>All the standing configuration data is defined from the
Setup tab
and each link should be reviewed to enter appropriate data for the
business. Setup wizards that guide you through this process has been
implemented and we strongly recommend you to use this approach, see <strong><em>Installation
steps (automatic, recommended)</em></strong> . </li>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ol>
<li>If FrontAccounting is installed locally, you may have the <strong><em>session
save path</em></strong> not set correctly. Normally this is
set in your php.ini (for Windows). The entry is called <strong><em>session.save_path</em></strong>.
Make sure this is set to a directory that actually exists. The default
is set to /tmp, which may not be valid. </li>
<li>If you are installing FrontAccounting onto a shared server,
you may have to set the session save path within FrontAccounting. At
the top of config.php (in release 2.0 this has moved to
/includes/session.inc) you will find this line : </li>
<li>Uncomment this line and set the path to a directory that
exists
on your server. Make sure that you have read/write privileges on this
directory. </li>
</ol>
