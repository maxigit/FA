<h2>Important Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can easily upload all the files to your installation folder on the
server overwriting the existing files, <strong><em>if you take these important
steps</em></strong>:
    <ol>
      <li>Backup&nbsp; (download) the following files to another folder:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>config_db.php</strong> (contains information about the&nbsp;companies and
connection info).
          </li>
          <li><strong>config.php</strong> (contains various settings. You only need to
backup this file if you have done manually changes to it.
          </li>
          <li><strong>/lang/installed_languages.inc</strong> (contains information about the
installed languages)
          </li>
          <li><strong>/modules/installed_modules.php</strong> (contains information about
installed modules<strong></strong>)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">installed_extensions.php</span> (contains information about installed extensions to the menu system)</li>
          <li>if you have made <em>changes to other files</em>, like themes or so, backup
these files too. </li>
        </ol>

      </li>
      <li>Upload all the new files.
      </li>
      <li>Restore the files mentioned in #1. Be <strong>careful</strong> with
        <strong>config.php</strong>. Look into variances. There might be new variables in
the new version. It might be easier to <em>manually change your former values in
the new file</em>.
      </li>
      <li>Rename or remove the /install folder (you have already performed the install
process earlier). </li>
    </ol>
  </li><li><strong>When
updating release&nbsp;2.0.X to release 2.1.X, you must immediately
login on company 0, the first company you created, as&nbsp;admin
(called the superadmin). If you use a theme other than the standard 3,
aqua, cool or default, switch to one of these before going further. You
can download a new one of the new themes on the download page.&nbsp; Go
to the 'Setup' tab and run 'Software
Upgrade'.
Mark the checkbox 'Install' and press 'Upgrade System'. &nbsp;This will
upgrade ALL your companies.</strong></li><li style="font-weight: bold;">If something goes wrong during upgrade, you can enter here again and try 'Force Upgrade', and press 'Upgrade System' again.</li><li><strong style="font-weight: bold;"></strong><strong>There are no database changes during a major and minor release. Like from 2.1 to 2.1.1 - 2.1.5 .</strong></li><li style="font-weight: bold;">When
updating from release 2.1.2 to 2.1.3, please go into Bank and General
Ledger tab. Enter Account Classes. Change the Class Types to a proper
value for all classes.</li>
