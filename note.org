* Investigate different type of Cart
** sales
*** order
    sales_order_entry : cart_class
*** display
Order display_order_summary in sales_order_entry
** Items
   items_cart for everything
   Transfer, adjustment, work
** Purchase
   ???
   purchase_order : = cart
* different modes
** one to clear everything first
 button or instruction at the beginingo fthe file !clear
** one to only apply modification
don't touch lines which are not mentioned in the file

*** different default mode ? delete, or update
Should that be part of the preprocessing
!upate
!delete
!+
!insert

part of the prceor
:> + *!
:<
* predefiniend variables

$@ stock_code
$$ price
$% discount
$| descripiton
$+ quantity
$! mode

 # from line
@ from database
* basic  preprocessing
** Doc
   template start with :
   commmand with !
   in template mode
   @ : FA or default 
   # : from the next line
   in line mode
   @ : FA or default 
   # : from the template
   # and @ are from the same field
   to address another field we might to something like $!
   [] : parenthis (we don't use () because it's easier to parse)

** example
   :ML12-AF3-# ${@+0.3} | sina # boto
   BLK, black
   ! hello // don't process this line
*** old
   or command start with : or !
   template line (starting with :)
   template can use 'database' default (ie FA computaed one)
   :ML12-AF1-% | % 
   :ML12-AF1-; | % 
   :ML12-AF1-& | % 
   :ML12-AF1-# | % 
   :ML12-AF1-~ | % 
   # can be used everywhere as the current one
   @ can be used as the default (from the database)
   
   (%*10) : arithmetic evaluation
   [] : string evaluation
   
   stuff between parenthhesis are evaluted

   | ()
*** done
add arithmetic
*** to do
csv mode 
add everytwhere (po and stock transfer)
clean
